    <h1>Testing Video Elements in HTML</h1>
    <section id="preface">
      <p>
        Here is an example of an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. The source
        specifies the image rendered to the page.
      </p>
      <h2>Example of Img Tag</h2>
      <img src="assets/success.png" width="500px" alt="Success" />
      <p>
        But we want a video. We can try and cheat by making the source a gif.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/thumbs-up.gif" alt="Thumbs up!" />
      <p>But HTML has a better way!</p>
    </section>

    <section id="video-local-file">
      <h1>Testing Video Element - local file</h1>
      <p>Let’s use a video element.</p>
      <p>It looks like this:</p>
      <code>&lt;video&gt;&lt;/video&gt;</code>
      <p>
        Just like the img tag, we need a src. I’ll add controls and a few other
        attributes as a test. This code should render the video to the page,
        automatically start playing the video muted and on a loop. We’ve also
        specified a width.
      </p>
      <video
        src="assets/dramatic-chipmunk.mp4"
        width="500px"
        controls
        autoplay
        muted
        loop
      ></video>
    </section>

    <section id="video-URL">
      <h1>Testing Video Element - URL</h1>
      <p>
        The source doesn’t always need to be local. For example if you have a
        video hosted somewhere, you can reference the URL.
      </p>
      <video controls>
        <source
          src="https://thenickedwards.github.io/HTML-110_Module-7_Video/assets/double-rainbow.mp4"
        />
      </video>
    </section>

    <section id="video-w-backups">
      <h1>Testing Video Element - with backups</h1>
      <p>
        It’s important to consider that not every user who visits your site to
        watch your incredible viral video will have a browser that supports your
        video filetype. You can help them out by specifying backups.
      </p>
      <p>
        The browser will try each source in the order listed and display the
        message if the video cannot be played. We can test this by using a
        different video as the backup. I’ll break the pathing to the chipmunk
        video and then we get this cat video instead.
      </p>
      <video height="250" controls autoplay muted loop>
        <source src="asset /dramatic-chipmunk.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        <source src="assets/keyboard-cat-backup.webm" type="video/webm" />
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
      </video>
    </section>

    <section id="video-embed">
      <h1>Testing Video Element - Embed</h1>
      <p>Another way to insert a video into your HTML is by embedding it.</p>
      <p>
        This is a pretty famous video that I want to make available but it’s
        important to remember that the host or owner of the video controls its
        access. If the user were to delete this video or their account or if the
        platform restricted access to the video or shut down, the video on my
        site would show as broken. Let’s check to make sure everything is
        working correctly.
      </p>
      <!-- EMBED - code copied from YouTube video share option -->

      <p>Perfect!</p>
      <p>
        If you’d like to dig deeper into this subject check out the
        documentation HTML elements such as for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>&lt;audio&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code>&lt;track&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code>&lt;object&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code>&lt;map&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code>&lt;picture&gt;</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That’s right there’s a <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and a
        <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> tag. There’s lots more to explore as far as
        including multimedia in your HTML.
